# C++ String Manipulator

A command-line application developed in C++ for performing various string manipulation tasks. This project was done in 2019 and showcases fundamental programming concepts.

## Features

- **String Manipulation:**
  - Reverse a word or phrase.
  - Convert text to uppercase.
  - Convert text to lowercase.
  - Randomize the letters in a string.
  - Sort letters in alphabetical order.
- **Interactive Menu:** A user-friendly menu for selecting different operations.

## How to Compile and Run

This project requires a C++ compiler (like g++ or Clang).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/himeltechfi/cpp-string-manipulator.git](https://github.com/himeltechfi/cpp-string-manipulator.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Compile the code:**
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o string-manipulator
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./string-manipulator
    ```

## About the Project

This C++ project was my first programming effort from 2019, created while I was learning the fundamentals of the language. It served as a practical application of core concepts like functions, loops, and conditional statements, resulting in a functional, interactive command-line tool for string manipulation.
