## [v1.0.0] - 2019-03-31

### Added
- Created `GetWord` function to get user input.

- Implemented a user-friendly menu and an endless loop for interaction.
- Developed a `QuitNow` function to exit the program.

### Changed
- Improved the `GetWord` function to handle full sentences instead of single words.
- Refactored code to improve clarity and structure.
- Updated menu logic to display last modified word and a default message for invalid options.
- Switched the menu variable from `int` to `char` and used ASCII values in the switch statement for robustness.

### Fixed

- Resolved issues with uppercase and lowercase functions to correctly process the entire string.
- Fixed an issue where the random function was not working by adjusting the menu call.
